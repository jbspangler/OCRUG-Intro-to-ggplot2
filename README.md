Presentation Materials for OCRUG ggplot2 intro

This repository is modeled on the recommended structure outlined here: https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-init

This places the projects into a number of sub-folders for easy relative directory referencing. The sub-directories are as follows:

                - code
                - data
                     - raw
                     - clean
                - doc
                - results
                     - figures
                     - pictures
                - scratch
